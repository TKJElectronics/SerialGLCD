This is the firmware and PCB for the SerialGLCD board by Kristian Lauszus, TKJ Electronics 2012.

For it to work move ks0108_Arduino.h into the glcd library folder like so: Arduino/libraries/glcd/config/ks0108_Arduino.h
Also remember to solder the solderjumper according to your Pinout (see http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Code/GLCDks0108).
The glcd library can be found at the following link: http://code.google.com/p/glcd-arduino/
